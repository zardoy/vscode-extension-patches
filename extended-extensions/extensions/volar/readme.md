## Extended volar

This is highly experimental version with a lot of benefits to make DX even better out of the box!

Featuring:

- Class links / references always work (even without `scope` attribute) [#1038](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/issues/1038)
- Support for Vue@2 options API without `defineComponent` or configuring jsconfig (limitation: still requires basic jsconfig.json creation)
